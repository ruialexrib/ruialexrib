My name is Rui Ribeiro, and I work in public service in the field of information systems development and management.

My main skills lie in analysis, planning, and design, as well as in the management and maintenance of information systems. I conduct functional tests, analyze improvement needs, and carry out updates and corrections. Additionally, I perform studies and technical documentation for the specification and contracting of IT service providers.

I have graduations in Information Systems Management, Accounting, and Administration, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Business Intelligence and Analytics.

I have both personal and professional interest in computer programming, data science, business intelligence, machine learning, project management, and information systems management.

I am characterized as an ambitious, self-motivated, and resilient professional with over 20 years of experience. I have acquired competencies in software development for finance, accounting, and management support.

I strive to add value by combining my computer programming knowledge with the business science skills I have acquired. My aim is to promote an integrated view of information systems with management, deepening and exploring knowledge and technological tools that meet market demands and business expectations, in line with the ongoing digital transformation.

I hold a Pedagogical Skills Certificate and work as a trainer in the areas of information systems, business sciences, and business intelligence.

I actively benefit from and contribute to the open-source community by consuming and providing source code, documentation, translations, and technical articles. My goal is always to increase synergies, networking, and continuous personal and professional improvement.
